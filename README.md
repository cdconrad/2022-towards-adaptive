This is the reporitory for the paper titled "Towards Mind Wandering Adaptive Online Learning and Virtual Work Experiences" presented at the 2022 NeuroIS Retreat. In this document you will find a jupyter notebook which contains the analysis described in the paper. To read the notebook contained in this file, you can click on it through Gihub, though we recommend using Jupyter with Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/

This file depends on a repository of scripts used for our 2018 study Neurophysiological Indicators of Attention in Information Technology Use, REB 2018-4404 at Dalhousie University, done through the <a href="https://ncil.science/">NeuroCognitive Imaging Lab</a>. This study was later nicknamed "aalis" for short, standing for "attention adaptive learning information systems". The results of this study were ultimately published in an article in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.697532/full">which can be found here</a>.
